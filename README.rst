Purpose
=======

This MFE is a host application demonstrating how we can dynamically compose micro-frontends together using Webpack Module Federation.  It has a single page which loads a hard-coded remote component from a companion MFE, `frontend-app-mf-guest`_.

.. _frontend-app-mf-guest: https://github.com/davidjoy/frontend-app-mf-guest

Running the two apps together demonstrates:

- Loading remote modules from another independently deployed MFE, guest.
- Sharing libraries from the host with the guest MFE.  ``react``, ``react-dom``, and ``@openedx/paragon`` are shared.
- Dynamic module federation - the host app does not need to know who the remote app is at build time.
- Hot module replacement for both host and remote.
- Dynamically loaded CSS modules.

Getting Started
===============

These MFEs do not need a running Open edX instance to function.  You're welcome.

#. Start this MFE with:

   .. code-block::

      cd frontend-app-mf-host
      nvm use
      npm ci
      npm start

#. Finally, open the MFE in a browser

   Navigate to `http://localhost:8080 <http://localhost:8080>`_ to open the
   MFE.  This is what it should look like if everything worked:

   .. figure:: ./docs/images/template.jpg

Known Issues
============

Hot module replacement breaks if a developer first changes the host and then the remote.  HMR loses track of the remote's HMR configuration when this happens, resulting in an error until the page is refreshed.  Basically, if you're developing the host, don't try to develop guest (a remote) in the same page load.
